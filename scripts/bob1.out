3 ways to illegally download movies
Online piracy is on the rise. But how does one download an illegal copy of a movie?
The simple answer is there are many ways.
Illegally downloading a movie doesn’t have to be hard. A few options are available for movie lovers.
1. Torrent sites
Torrent sites make it easy to download a movie. Simply search for the movie and download it.
Popular torrent sites include:
But beware: Torrent sites are illegal. The sites can be used to obtain copyrighted materials without permission. They also can pose a security risk. Some sites host viruses and malware.
It is important to note that downloading a movie doesn’t necessarily mean the movie is illegal. A legal copy of a movie is available for purchase or rental.
2. Streaming sites
Streaming sites like Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Amazon Prime are becoming more popular. These sites offer a wide variety of movies and shows for viewing.
You can watch the movies for free, if you sign up for a trial subscription. The downside is you will have to pay a monthly subscription fee after the trial period is over.
Amazon Prime has a monthly subscription price of $8.99 per month.
There are ways to access the sites without paying. The primary way is to use a VPN (virtual private network). This makes it possible to change your IP address. This will allow you to pretend you are in another country.
For example, you can pretend you are in the United Kingdom or Japan. The United Kingdom offers Netflix and Amazon Prime. Japan offers Hulu.
3. Websites that offer illegal copies of movies
You may be able to find websites that offer free downloads. These sites often are a source of viruses, malware and other harmful files.
The FBI has taken action against illegal websites, and some have been shut down. But this doesn’t mean the threat is gone.
If you find a website that offers illegal downloads, you may be able to get it shut down.
File a complaint with the Internet Watch Foundation. This nonprofit, charitable organization helps fight illegal content online.
If you believe the content infringes on copyrights, file a complaint with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States law that protects online copyrights. It states that copyright holders have the right to take action against online infringement.
The act also says you can’t be held liable for copyright violations if you take certain actions.
Consider using the TorrentFreak Search Engine. This is a search engine designed specifically to locate illegal torrent sites.
The TorrentFreak search engine has the ability to block banned websites and filter out malware.
Remember, downloading a movie isn’t illegal. But piracy is.
Downloading illegal copies of movies can pose a security risk. It also can lead to viruses and malware.
File a complaint with the FBI or the Internet Watch Foundation to report illegal websites. If you choose to use a VPN, consider using one that’s trusted, like TorGuard.
